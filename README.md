# MyNotesAppBackend
this is the backend of MyCodeApp created with spring framework, it has rest api support and stores data to a designated sql server using hibernate.
To store data consistently, there are 4 tables, 3 of which act as directories, and subdirectories while the fourth stores the actual data. 
This aims to achieve the hierarchical structure of local storage in any regular pc like directories and sub directories but adds an intutive UI and easy access to notes 
accross all devices via web
